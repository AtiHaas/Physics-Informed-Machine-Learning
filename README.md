# Physics Informed Machine Learning - Literature review

This review was conducted as part of my engineering degree at Imperial, worth 5 ECTS credits. Following a thorough evaluation by two separate assessors, it received an A grade.


## Abstract

This literature review introduces the concept of Physics Informed Machine Learning (PIML) aimed
at an audience new to the subject, but already familiar with classical machine learning (ML) and
engineering. Beginning from the limitations of both physics based and purely data driven methods,
the motivation for blending the two is presented. This usually involves adapting existing ML solutions
to conform to laws of physics. Several methods for such augmentations are then explored: using
simulations as training data, customising the cost function and designing network architecture. Next,
several compelling examples of applications are presented, which each highlight special features of
PIML approaches. These include but are not limited to label-free training, surrogate based modelling
and ill-posed problem solving. To showcase these, research from several scientific fields are considered
with a focus on fibre reinforced composites. Finally, the current hurdles of PIML are highlighted and
future promising areas of research identified.
